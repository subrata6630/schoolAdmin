                        <p>Education is considered to be the core instrument of human development and its aim is to promote excellence in all spheres of life. Aristotle said “The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet”.  Formal education provides comprehensive opportunity to reap the sweeter benefit of education.  We believe that the role of an educational institution is not only to pursue academic excellence, but also to motivate and empower its student to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers, and productive members of ever-changing society.  SchoolEdge has started its journey to make a small effort in this regard and thus to be a part in the development of the community. 
                            As children grow, professionals advise us to emphasize three important domains, these are:</P>
                                   
								   <p class="font-weight-normal">Affective: This deals with spiritual emotions. The affective domain includes factors such as student motivation attitudes, perceptions and values.</p> 
								   <p class="font-weight-normal">Cognitive: The domain is to do with mental process including how people think, perceive, remember and learn.</p>
								    <p class="font-weight-normal">Psycho-social stage: This is all about developing muscles. Learning is developed by physical skills such as movement, coordination and manipulation.  </p>
								
                            <p>Our school is launched by a pool of a very strong, experienced, and dedicated team of educators with an objective of all out education in character building, leadership development, extra and co-curricular activities along with highest quality academic training.  Our commitment to small class size, up to date curriculum along with state of the art facilities inside and outside the classroom will definitely provide a unique opportunity for maximum learning and development of a student. However, we believe that best education requires a shared commitment between dedicated teachers, motivated students and enthusiastic parents with high expectation. The triangular working relationship would be focused to materialize above dimensions of education.    
                            I am thrilled to be a part of such a welcoming, vibrant, and positive community in the set up of a dynamic institution.  I look forward to working with colleagues, parents and students to forward the values and goals that are important to us all.
                            </p>
